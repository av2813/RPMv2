Features:
	- Make the graphs default to square
	- Dumbell model simultation
		- Add in a 'monopole' field calculation
	- Fix the out of plane calculation
	- Add a function that plots the sum of the vertices on each lattice
	- Add a bar that shows the magnitude of the quiver arrow in the field plot


Benchmarks:
	- 4x4 solutions compared with an analytical calculation
	- Sweep parameter space
	- 


Literature Review:
	- Check how correlation factor is defined
		+ Correlation factor is defined as the difference between the n and n+1 spin states. Where n is the number of minor loops
		+ Update the code to reflect that
